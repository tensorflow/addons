# tfa.image.median_filter2d

This method performs Median Filtering on image. Filter shape can be user

### Aliases:

* `tfa.image.filters.median_filter2d`
* `tfa.image.median_filter2d`

``` python
tfa.image.median_filter2d(
    image,
    filter_shape=(3, 3),

given.

This method takes both kind of images where pixel values lie between 0 to
255 and where it lies between 0.0 and 1.0
Args:
    image: A 3D `Tensor` of type `float32` or 'int32' or 'float64' or
           'int64 and of shape`[rows, columns, channels]`

    filter_shape: Optional Argument. A tuple of 2 integers (R,C).
           R is the first value is the number of rows in the filter and
           C is the second value in the filter is the number of columns
           in the filter. This creates a filter of shape (R,C) or RxC
           filter. Default value = (3,3)
    name: The name of the op.

 Returns:
     A 3D median filtered image tensor of shape [rows,columns,channels] and
     type 'int32'. Pixel value of returned tensor ranges between 0 to 255
