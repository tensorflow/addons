# tfa.image.transform_ops.compose_transforms

Composes the transforms tensors.

``` python
tfa.image.transform_ops.compose_transforms(
    transforms,
    name=None
)
```



Defined in [`image/transform_ops.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/tree/0.4-release/tensorflow_addons/image/transform_ops.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->


#### Args:


* <b>`transforms`</b>: List of image projective transforms to be composed. Each
  transform is length 8 (single transform) or shape (N, 8) (batched
  transforms). The shapes of all inputs must be equal, and at least one
  input must be given.
* <b>`name`</b>: The name for the op.


#### Returns:

A composed transform tensor. When passed to `transform` op,
    equivalent to applying each of the given transforms to the image in
    order.
