<!-- Equality marker -->
Computes the npairs loss between multilabel data `y_true` and `y_pred`.

**Aliases**: `tfa.losses.npairs.npairs_multilabel_loss`

``` python
tfa.losses.npairs_multilabel_loss(
    y_true,
    y_pred
)
```



<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Npairs loss expects paired data where a pair is composed of samples from
the same labels and each pairs in the minibatch have different labels.
The loss takes each row of the pair-wise similarity matrix, `y_pred`,
as logits and the remapped multi-class labels, `y_true`, as labels.

To deal with multilabel inputs, the count of label intersection
is computed as follows:

```
L_{i,j} = | set_of_labels_for(i) \cap set_of_labels_for(j) |
```

Each row of the count based label matrix is further normalized so that
each row sums to one.

`y_true` should be a binary indicator for classes.
That is, if `y_true[i, j] = 1`, then `i`th sample is in `j`th class;
if `y_true[i, j] = 0`, then `i`th sample is not in `j`th class.

The similarity matrix `y_pred` between two embedding matrices `a` and `b`
with shape `[batch_size, hidden_size]` can be computed as follows:

```python
# y_pred = a * b^T
y_pred = tf.matmul(a, b, transpose_a=False, transpose_b=True)
```

#### Args:


* <b>`y_true`</b>: Either 2-D integer `Tensor` with shape
  `[batch_size, num_classes]`, or `SparseTensor` with dense shape
  `[batch_size, num_classes]`. If `y_true` is a `SparseTensor`, then
  it will be converted to `Tensor` via `tf.sparse.to_dense` first.

* <b>`y_pred`</b>: 2-D float `Tensor` with shape `[batch_size, batch_size]` of
  similarity matrix between embedding matrices.


#### Returns:


* <b>`npairs_multilabel_loss`</b>: float scalar.
