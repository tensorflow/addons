# tfa.seq2seq.Decoder

## Class `Decoder`

An RNN Decoder abstract interface object.



### Aliases:

* Class `tfa.seq2seq.Decoder`
* Class `tfa.seq2seq.decoder.Decoder`



Defined in [`seq2seq/decoder.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/tree/0.4-release/tensorflow_addons/seq2seq/decoder.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Concepts used by this interface:
- `inputs`: (structure of) tensors and TensorArrays that is passed as input
  to the RNNCell composing the decoder, at each time step.
- `state`: (structure of) tensors and TensorArrays that is passed to the
  RNNCell instance as the state.
- `finished`: boolean tensor telling whether each sequence in the batch is
  finished.
- `outputs`: Instance of BasicDecoderOutput. Result of the decoding, at
  each time step.

## Properties

<h3 id="batch_size"><code>batch_size</code></h3>

The batch size of input values.


<h3 id="output_dtype"><code>output_dtype</code></h3>

A (possibly nested tuple of...) dtype[s].


<h3 id="output_size"><code>output_size</code></h3>

A (possibly nested tuple of...) integer[s] or `TensorShape`
object[s].

<h3 id="tracks_own_finished"><code>tracks_own_finished</code></h3>

Describes whether the Decoder keeps track of finished states.

Most decoders will emit a true/false `finished` value independently
at each time step.  In this case, the `dynamic_decode` function keeps
track of which batch entries are already finished, and performs a
logical OR to insert new batches to the finished set.

Some decoders, however, shuffle batches / beams between time steps and
`dynamic_decode` will mix up the finished state across these entries
because it does not track the reshuffle across time steps. In this
case, it is up to the decoder to declare that it will keep track of its
own finished state by setting this property to `True`.

#### Returns:

Python bool.




## Methods

<h3 id="finalize"><code>finalize</code></h3>

``` python
finalize(
    outputs,
    final_state,
    sequence_lengths
)
```




<h3 id="initialize"><code>initialize</code></h3>

``` python
initialize(name=None)
```

Called before any decoding iterations.

This methods must compute initial input values and initial state.

#### Args:


* <b>`name`</b>: Name scope for any created operations.


#### Returns:

`(finished, initial_inputs, initial_state)`: initial values of
'finished' flags, inputs and state.


<h3 id="step"><code>step</code></h3>

``` python
step(
    time,
    inputs,
    state,
    name=None
)
```

Called per step of decoding (but only once for dynamic decoding).


#### Args:


* <b>`time`</b>: Scalar `int32` tensor. Current step number.
* <b>`inputs`</b>: RNNCell input (possibly nested tuple of) tensor[s] for this
  time step.
* <b>`state`</b>: RNNCell state (possibly nested tuple of) tensor[s] from
  previous time step.
* <b>`name`</b>: Name scope for any created operations.


#### Returns:

`(outputs, next_state, next_inputs, finished)`: `outputs` is an
object containing the decoder output, `next_state` is a (structure
of) state tensors and TensorArrays, `next_inputs` is the tensor that
should be used as input for the next step, `finished` is a boolean
tensor telling whether the sequence is complete, for each sequence in
the batch.
