        "* **Layer Normalization** (TensorFlow Core)\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea behind these layers is to normalize the output of an activation layer to improve the convergence during training. In contrast to [batch normalization](https://keras.io/layers/normalization/) these normalizations do not work on batches, instead they normalize the activations of a single sample, making them suitable for recurrent neural networks as well. \n",
        "\n",
        "Typically the normalization is performed by calculating the mean and the standard deviation of a subgroup in your input tensor. It is also possible to apply a scale and an offset factor to this as well.\n",

You can activate these factors by setting the `center` or the `scale` flag to `True`. Of course you can use `initializers`, `constraints` and `regularizer` for `beta` and `gamma` to tune these values during the training process. "
