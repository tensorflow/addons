# TensorFlow Addons Tutorials

TensorFlow Addons welcomes and highly encourages tutorial contributions.


## How To Contribute

Addons tutorials are created using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) 
and the jupyter notebooks are saved to this directory in the repository. To do 
this, follow the below steps:

1. Create a new branch on your fork of TensorFlow Addons
2. Goto [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and start a new 
notebook using addons example template:
[docs/tutorials/_template.ipynb](_template.ipynb)
3. Edit the links for the "View source on GitHub" and "Run in Google Colab" 
URL boxes so that they match the name of your new example notebook
4. Follow the guidelines of the template
5. "Save a copy in GitHub" and select your new branch. The notebook should be 
named `subpackage_submodule`
6. Submit the branch as a PR on the TF-Addons GitHub
