            TensorFlow Addons is a repository of contributions that conform to
            well-established API patterns, but implement new functionality
            not available in core TensorFlow. TensorFlow natively supports
            a large number of operators, layers, metrics, losses, and
            optimizers. However, in a fast moving field like ML, there are many
            interesting new developments that cannot be integrated into core
            TensorFlow (because their broad applicability is not yet clear, or
            it is mostly used by a smaller subset of the community).
