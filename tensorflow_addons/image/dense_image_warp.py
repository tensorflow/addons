    """Image warping using per-pixel flow vectors.

    Apply a non-linear warp to the image, where the warp is specified by a
    dense flow field of offset vectors that define the correspondences of
    pixel values in the output image back to locations in the source image.
    Specifically, the pixel value at `output[b, j, i, c]` is
    `images[b, j - flow[b, j, i, 0], i - flow[b, j, i, 1], c]`.

    The locations specified by this formula do not necessarily map to an int
    index. Therefore, the pixel value is obtained by bilinear
    interpolation of the 4 nearest pixels around
    `(b, j - flow[b, j, i, 0], i - flow[b, j, i, 1])`. For locations outside
    of the image, we use the nearest pixel values at the image boundary.

    NOTE: The definition of the flow field above is different from that
    of optical flow. This function expects the negative forward flow from
    output image to source image. Given two images `I_1` and `I_2` and the
    optical flow `F_12` from `I_1` to `I_2`, the image `I_1` can be
    reconstructed by `I_1_rec = dense_image_warp(I_2, -F_12)`.

    Args:
      image: 4-D float `Tensor` with shape `[batch, height, width, channels]`.
      flow: A 4-D float `Tensor` with shape `[batch, height, width, 2]`.
      name: A name for the operation (optional).

      Note that image and flow can be of type `tf.half`, `tf.float32`, or
      `tf.float64`, and do not necessarily have to be the same type.

    Returns:
      A 4-D float `Tensor` with shape`[batch, height, width, channels]`
        and same type as input image.

    Raises:
      ValueError: if `height < 2` or `width < 2` or the inputs have the wrong
        number of dimensions.
