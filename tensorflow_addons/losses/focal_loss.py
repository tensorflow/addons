    """Implements the focal loss function.

    Focal loss was first introduced in the RetinaNet paper
    (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02002.pdf). Focal loss is extremely useful for
    classification when you have highly imbalanced classes. It down-weights
    well-classified examples and focuses on hard examples. The loss value is
    much high for a sample which is misclassified by the classifier as compared
    to the loss value corresponding to a well-classified example. One of the
    best use-cases of focal loss is its usage in object detection where the
    imbalance between the background class and other classes is extremely high.

    Usage:

    >>> fl = tfa.losses.SigmoidFocalCrossEntropy()
    >>> loss = fl(
    ...     y_true = [[1.0], [1.0], [0.0]],y_pred = [[0.97], [0.91], [0.03]])
    >>> loss

    dtype=float32)>

    Usage with `tf.keras` API:

    >>> model = tf.keras.Model()
    >>> model.compile('sgd', loss=tfa.losses.SigmoidFocalCrossEntropy())

    Args:
      alpha: balancing factor, default value is 0.25.
      gamma: modulating factor, default value is 2.0.

    Returns:
      Weighted loss float `Tensor`. If `reduction` is `NONE`, this has the same
          shape as `y_true`; otherwise, it is scalar.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the shape of `sample_weight` is invalid or value of
          `gamma` is less than zero.
