    """Weighted cross-entropy loss for a sequence of logits.

    Depending on the values of `average_across_timesteps` /
    `sum_over_timesteps` and `average_across_batch` / `sum_over_batch`, the
    return Tensor will have rank 0, 1, or 2 as these arguments reduce the
    cross-entropy at each target, which has shape
    `[batch_size, sequence_length]`, over their respective dimensions. For
    example, if `average_across_timesteps` is `True` and `average_across_batch`
    is `False`, then the return Tensor will have shape `[batch_size]`.

    Note that `average_across_timesteps` and `sum_over_timesteps` cannot be
    True at same time. Same for `average_across_batch` and `sum_over_batch`.

    The recommended loss reduction in tf 2.0 has been changed to sum_over,
    instead of weighted average. User are recommend to use `sum_over_timesteps`
    and `sum_over_batch` for reduction.

    Args:
      logits: A Tensor of shape
        `[batch_size, sequence_length, num_decoder_symbols]` and dtype float.
        The logits correspond to the prediction across all classes at each
        timestep.
      targets: A Tensor of shape `[batch_size, sequence_length]` and dtype
        int. The target represents the true class at each timestep.
      weights: A Tensor of shape `[batch_size, sequence_length]` and dtype
        float. `weights` constitutes the weighting of each prediction in the
        sequence. When using `weights` as masking, set all valid timesteps to 1
        and all padded timesteps to 0, e.g. a mask returned by
        `tf.sequence_mask`.
      average_across_timesteps: If set, sum the cost across the sequence
        dimension and divide the cost by the total label weight across
        timesteps.
      average_across_batch: If set, sum the cost across the batch dimension and
        divide the returned cost by the batch size.
      sum_over_timesteps: If set, sum the cost across the sequence dimension
        and divide the size of the sequence. Note that any element with 0
        weights will be excluded from size calculation.
      sum_over_batch: if set, sum the cost across the batch dimension and
        divide the total cost by the batch size. Not that any element with 0
        weights will be excluded from size calculation.
      softmax_loss_function: Function (labels, logits) -> loss-batch
        to be used instead of the standard softmax (the default if this is
        None). **Note that to avoid confusion, it is required for the function
        to accept named arguments.**
      name: Optional name for this operation, defaults to "sequence_loss".

    Returns:
      A float Tensor of rank 0, 1, or 2 depending on the
      `average_across_timesteps` and `average_across_batch` arguments. By
      default, it has rank 0 (scalar) and is the weighted average cross-entropy
      (log-perplexity) per symbol.

    Raises:
      ValueError: logits does not have 3 dimensions or targets does not have 2
                  dimensions or weights does not have 2 dimensions.
