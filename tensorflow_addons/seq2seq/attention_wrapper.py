    """A base AttentionMechanism class providing common functionality.

    Common functionality includes:
      1. Storing the query and memory layers.
      2. Preprocessing and storing the memory.

    Note that this layer takes memory as its init parameter, which is an
    anti-pattern of Keras API, we have to keep the memory as init parameter for
    performance and dependency reason. Under the hood, during `__init__()`, it
    will invoke `base_layer.__call__(memory, setup_memory=True)`. This will let
    keras to keep track of the memory tensor as the input of this layer. Once
    the `__init__()` is done, then user can query the attention by
    `score = att_obj([query, state])`, and use it as a normal keras layer.

    Special attention is needed when adding using this class as the base layer
    for new attention:
      1. Build() could be invoked at least twice. So please make sure weights
         are not duplicated.
      2. Layer.get_weights() might return different set of weights if the
         instance has `query_layer`. The query_layer weights is not initialized
         until the memory is configured.

    Also note that this layer does not work with Keras model when
    `model.compile(run_eagerly=True)` due to the fact that this layer is
    stateful. The support for that will be added in a future version.

    Monotonic attention implies that the input sequence is processed in an
    explicitly left-to-right manner when generating the output sequence.  In
    addition, once an input sequence element is attended to at a given output
    timestep, elements occurring before it cannot be attended to at subsequent
    output timesteps.  This function generates attention distributions
    according to these assumptions.  For more information, see `Online and
    Linear-Time Attention by Enforcing Monotonic Alignments`.

    Args:
      p_choose_i: Probability of choosing input sequence/memory element i.
        Should be of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length), and should all
        be in the range [0, 1].
      previous_attention: The attention distribution from the previous output
        timestep.  Should be of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length).  For
        the first output timestep, preevious_attention[n] should be
        [1, 0, 0, ..., 0] for all n in [0, ... batch_size - 1].
      mode: How to compute the attention distribution.  Must be one of
        'recursive', 'parallel', or 'hard'.
          * 'recursive' uses tf.scan to recursively compute the distribution.
            This is slowest but is exact, general, and does not suffer from
            numerical instabilities.
          * 'parallel' uses parallelized cumulative-sum and cumulative-product
            operations to compute a closed-form solution to the recurrence
            relation defining the attention distribution.  This makes it more
            efficient than 'recursive', but it requires numerical checks which
            make the distribution non-exact.  This can be a problem in
            particular when input_sequence_length is long and/or p_choose_i has
            entries very close to 0 or 1.
          * 'hard' requires that the probabilities in p_choose_i are all either
            0 or 1, and subsequently uses a more efficient and exact solution.

        Args:
          cell: An instance of `RNNCell`.
          attention_mechanism: A list of `AttentionMechanism` instances or a
            single instance.
          attention_layer_size: A list of Python integers or a single Python
            integer, the depth of the attention (output) layer(s). If None
            (default), use the context as attention at each time step.
            Otherwise, feed the context and cell output into the attention
            layer to generate attention at each time step. If
            attention_mechanism is a list, attention_layer_size must be a list
            of the same length. If attention_layer is set, this must be None.
            If attention_fn is set, it must guaranteed that the outputs of
            attention_fn also meet the above requirements.
          alignment_history: Python boolean, whether to store alignment history
            from all time steps in the final output state (currently stored as
            a time major `TensorArray` on which you must call `stack()`).
          cell_input_fn: (optional) A `callable`.  The default is:
            `lambda inputs, attention:
              tf.concat([inputs, attention], -1)`.
          output_attention: Python bool.  If `True` (default), the output at
            each time step is the attention value.  This is the behavior of
            Luong-style attention mechanisms.  If `False`, the output at each
            time step is the output of `cell`.  This is the behavior of
            Bhadanau-style attention mechanisms.  In both cases, the
            `attention` tensor is propagated to the next time step via the
            state and is used there. This flag only controls whether the
            attention mechanism is propagated up to the next cell in an RNN
            stack or to the top RNN output.
          initial_cell_state: The initial state value to use for the cell when
            the user calls `get_initial_state()`.  Note that if this value is
            provided now, and the user uses a `batch_size` argument of
            `get_initial_state` which does not match the batch size of
            `initial_cell_state`, proper behavior is not guaranteed.
          name: Name to use when creating ops.
          attention_layer: A list of `tf.tf.keras.layers.Layer` instances or a
            single `tf.tf.keras.layers.Layer` instance taking the context
            and cell output as inputs to generate attention at each time step.
            If None (default), use the context as attention at each time step.
            If attention_mechanism is a list, attention_layer must be a list of
            the same length. If attention_layers_size is set, this must be
            None.
          attention_fn: An optional callable function that allows users to
            provide their own customized attention function, which takes input
            (attention_mechanism, cell_output, attention_state,
            attention_layer) and outputs (attention, alignments,
            next_attention_state). If provided, the attention_layer_size should
            be the size of the outputs of attention_fn.
