# Migration From TF-Addons To TensorFlow Core / Keras

**Given the challenges of external SIG coordinating with internal roadmaps, a new 
process has been put in place for the core TF and Keras teams to handle migration 
and deprecation of Addons components. If you believe there is a strong candidate for 
migration please post an issue and we'll escalate it to the respective team members.**

### Criteria for Migration
* The addition is widely used throughout the community
* The addition is unlikely to have API changes as time progresses
* The addition is well written / tested
